# SAP Network Architecture
Improve the security of your SAP landscape by implementing a Network Segmentation and Stop opening unnecessary ports and protocols.

## Network Segmentation
Network segmentation is an architecture that divides a computer network into smaller sections or subnets. 
Each network segment acts as its own network, which provides security teams with increased control over the traffic that flows into their systems.

## Basic Checklist
* Ensure your firewall is properly configured and all rules are regularly audited and updated.
* Secure remote access points and remote users.
* Block any unnecessary network ports.
* Disable and remove unused or extraneous protocols and services.
* Encrypt network traffic.
